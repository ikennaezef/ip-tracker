## Overview

On this application, you can search for any IP Address and see some key information about the address, including its location. You can also search for domains to get the same result. When the page loads initially without any input, the app shows the IP Address and other info of the user. The application is fully responsive.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I'm getting better at my use of styled components. It is a quite effective way of writing styles and it helps keep your files organised. I hope to keep on using it with ReactJS. In the project, I had some difficulty trying to implement a live map in using the location information gotten from the API. Hopefully, I'll implement a live map later on and release an improved version of the IP Tracker App.
